# qotd
QOTD (quote of the day) is specified in [RFC 865](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc865) as a way of broadcasting a quote to users. Port 17 on both TCP and UDP is reserved for this purpose. This program is meant to provide a simple QOTD daemon. See also [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QOTD).
